### Orignal Description

**Firewalls** are becoming increasingly important in today's world. Hackers and automated scripts are constantly trying to **invade your system** and use it for Bitcoin mining, botnets or other things.

To prevent these attacks, you can use a firewall on your system. **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in Linux because it can **filter packets in the kernel** before they reach the application. Using IPTables is **not very easy** for Linux beginners. We have created easywall - the simple **IPTables web interface**. The focus of the software is on easy installation and use.

### Features

- **Logging** - of blocked connections and many other stuff.
- **IPv6** - is completely supported since it should be used on every system.
- **Two step activation** - Changed rules are activated in two steps to check the connection.
- **Blacklisting and Whitelisting** - of IP addresses and IPv6 addresses.
- **Port Forewarding** - Forward Ports through the Firewall.
- **TCP, UDP and Port Ranges** - Open them if you need them in the internet.
- **Own IPTables rules** - Can be managed in the web interface.
