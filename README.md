## Orignal Heading

**Firewalls** are becoming increasingly important in today's world. Hackers and automated scripts are constantly trying to **invade your system** and use it for Bitcoin mining, botnets or other things.

To prevent these attacks, you can use a firewall on your system. **IPTables** is the strongest firewall in Linux because it can **filter packets in the kernel** before they reach the application. Using IPTables is **not very easy** for Linux beginners. We have created easywall - the simple **IPTables web interface**. The focus of the software is on easy installation and use.

## Support me

The project easywall was created in a time when I did not have any knowledge about Linux. Today I work as an administrator for Linux systems and would not need this project anymore. Nevertheless it is important to me to support the introduction to Linux and the use and simplification of firewalls.

To continue the project, I need your support! Please donate so that I can continue the project in my spare time. Every dollar counts! You can find a donation link on [GitHub](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall).
